This is a list of things that I need
to eventually incorporate in my neovim
config.

GIT
Waiting for some more experience with
tmux and using git commands before
becoming too plugin dependent
- Git Signs
- Lazy Git

DEBUG
typecraft debugging video
I don't even use debugging in VSCode yet,
I want to understand why I need it more
before I try to do all that with
breakpoints and such

TMUX-VIM OVERLAP
This is stuff like tmuxifier and having
test cases automatically open a new
terminal, just not really in my scope
of usage yet cuz I don't even do test
driven development yet

REDO TMUX KEYBINDS
Want to make them more intuitive with vim
in general, especially splits, but I
could also just learn them

FIX CERTAIN LITTLE ERRORS
[ ] Autocomplete keybinds and making
    up and down arrow keys in menus
        May keep for more vim (no arrowkeys)
[ ] Auto wrap/unwrap for markdown files

MAKE THINGS LOOK BETTER
- Implementing neoscroll
- Actually having custom themes for neovim and for tmux?
  - The thing is I actually really like whatever it is right now
